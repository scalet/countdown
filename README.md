#Countdown Timer
This countdown is based on my friends idea Alexandre Almeida when I used to work at Directcall, after that I've made one for me but I wanted to change this one.

Inside of custom.js you can change the gifs collection and make one to yourself, you need to change the file https://gist.githubusercontent.com/scalet/49716b71b9b70040dce76843e4e5c0c8/raw/bcd3d6f2643a497b6425c86f3b75dd4963061739/countdown-images.json. This is a simple json with an array of gif links.
You also can change the first gif changing ARR_IMAGES and the body url to one by your choice.

First of all, you need to enter with the name of the countdown. After that you enter with the end Hour. That will be your countdown changing gifs behind.
If you want to change the name and hour of your countdown, you just need to click on refresh button at the right bottom of the page.

You can also use this one on my website http://countdown.renan.tech. Is the same code.

Have fun!
