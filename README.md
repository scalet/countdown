## Countdown Timer
This countdown is based on my friends idea Alexandre Almeida.

#### Start
Set up the name and end hour of the countdown.
Then the countdown will run changing gifs behind.
If you want to change the name and hour of your countdown, you just need to click on refresh button at the right bottom of the page.

#### Setting up your own gifs
Making the countdown with yours images
Inside of custom.js you can change the gifs collection and make one to yourself, you need to change the gist link to your on json. 
This is a simple json with an array of gif links. Also, you can change the first gif changing ARR_IMAGES on custom.js and the body background url on custom.css to one by your choice.




## Have fun!
