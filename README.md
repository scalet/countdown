Countdown Timer
This countdown is based on my friends idea Alexandre Almeida when I used to work at Directcall, after that I've made one for me but I want to change to this one.

First of all, you need to enter with the name of the countdown. After that you enter with the end Hour. That will be your countdown changing gifs behind.
If you want to change the name and hour of your countdown, you just need to click on refresh button at the right bottom of the page.

Making the countdown with yours images
Inside of custom.js you can change the gifs collection and make one to yourself, you need to change the gist link to your on json. This is a simple json with an array of gif links.
Also, you can change the first gif changing ARR_IMAGES on custom.js and the body background url on custom.css to one by your choice.

If you don't want to spend time clonning this one, you can use this tool on my website countdown.renan.tech

Have fun!
